To build an indian ASR model 

# Problem Statement

# Noise detection and cancellation 

India is a country of multiple languages and dialects. The Next 200 million consumers from Bharat have different dialects and a huge potential to solve. While working on recognizing these accurately, ASR models have to be robust for handling various sources of audio. 
For example, while a user is interacting with a shopping app by speaking into his/her phone, there may be an additional sound like a television or some person talking nearby that gets added in the background. This additional sound input can have adverse effects on the interaction by the primary user and can make the overall voice search feature less effective. 
For this, you would have to come up with a solution which can categorize the audios based on source and also separate the audios from different sources.
